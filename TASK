We are seeking an experienced Solana blockchain developer to design and implement a token launch mechanism, bonding curve pricing, and treasury management system through Solana smart contracts. The ideal candidate should have a deep understanding of Solana's programming ecosystem, including Rust, Anchor, and the Token Program, as well as experience building smart contracts for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications.

Key Responsibilities:
Token Creation and Management:
  Develop a token launch mechanism that mints a fixed supply of 1,000,000,000 tokens, including metadata integration for token name, symbol, and additional details.
  
Bonding Curve Implementation:
  Design and integrate a dynamic pricing mechanism using a bonding curve formula to adjust token prices based on demand.

Treasury Management:
  Create a smart contract that collects funds from token purchases into a treasury account, automates treasury handling, and triggers liquidity pool creation when the treasury reaches a specified threshold (e.g., $100,000).

Swap and DEX Integration: 
  Programmatically create a liquidity pair on a decentralized exchange (DEX) and ensure seamless token trading once the treasury conditions are met.

Security and Performance:
  Write secure, efficient, and well-documented smart contracts with a focus on avoiding common vulnerabilities and optimizing performance.

Required Skills and Qualifications:
Proven experience in Solana development, including Rust and Anchor Framework.  
- Strong understanding of Solana's Token Program and Program Derived Addresses (PDAs).  
- Experience building and deploying DeFi protocols (e.g., token swaps, bonding curves, liquidity pools).  
- Familiarity with decentralized exchanges on Solana.  
- Ability to write robust unit tests and conduct debugging to ensure contract reliability.  
- Knowledge of Solana's on-chain data structures and RPC APIs.  
- Strong documentation and communication skills.

Deliverables:
1. Fully functional Solana smart contracts for token minting, bonding curve pricing, and treasury management.  
2. Integration with a specified DEX for liquidity pool creation.  
3. Comprehensive technical documentation and deployment guide.  
4. A suite of unit tests and testing scripts to validate functionality.
